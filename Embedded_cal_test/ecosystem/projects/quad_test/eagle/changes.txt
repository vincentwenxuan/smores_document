1. Slave select pin of the ATRF needs to be connected to a microcontroller pin (any GPIO is fine).
2. Reset and Sleep pins of the ATRF need to be pulled up and down respectively. The reset pin can also be connected to a microcontroller pin if possible, though this is not really needed.
3. The pull-up resistors on the I2C need to be smaller, I see very slow rise times on the bus with the 10k ones. 1k works fine it seems, though I'm still not sure why we need such a strong pull-up.
4. Just check the RC timeout on the reset latch. One of the boards has an irritatingly short timeout.
5. Pull down on the gates of the motor FETs. ??Necessary??
6. Boot button change to button push hold plus power cycle with switch
7. Flyback diodes across motors
8. Test pads on comms lines (and perhaps others?)
9. Reverse polarity protection
10. IMU axis
11. Serial breakout?
12. EMI supression on USB
