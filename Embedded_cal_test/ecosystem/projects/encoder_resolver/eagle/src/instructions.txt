Here they are,  good luck!  Remember to have good power supply filtering.  The 12V rail may be really noisy.  Transformer part# is in the documents.  Remember to hook it up correctly paying attention to the dots.  Side with the higher inductance in model has more windings.  If you pick another op-amp, can you show me which one?  I want to make sure it will pass checks for output current, high and low voltage under load, input bias current, offset, and PSRR.  Thanks.
