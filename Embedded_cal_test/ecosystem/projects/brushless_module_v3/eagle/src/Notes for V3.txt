Round, not square
Mount holes not 90deg from usb (for mounting reasons) (mounting holes at 45deg, usb and motor at ordinal)
Radio footprint vs atmel gerbers
Can the Vreg tell us when it's on?  Yes, use the PG pin!  Use micro internal pu. (Don't bother, see below)
Yash sexy button (vreg with enables required)
Bigger antenna via (or chip antenna)
Current sensor voltage divider needs 1ks, not 10ks or 1.65 ref voltage (probs 1.65 ref reg) (dac?)
Should have individual voltage dividers because long wires crossing fets get noise
Route analog lines from current sensors smartly, no crossing fets or poss differential measurement
move current sensors and thermistor up so 3.3 doesn't have to go to bottom
Big ceramic vs tant?
smaller fets?
smd usb (DONE)
cap on reset?
Thermistor? If board could be smaller, no

Vreg takes up a lot of space!  Can we make it smaller???
TPS62172DSGT with BRC2012T2R2MD .5A more efficient and inductor smidge smaller
TPS62162DSGT with SRP2010-2R2M 1A
