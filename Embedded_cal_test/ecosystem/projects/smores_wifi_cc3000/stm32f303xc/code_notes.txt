Change Magnet state number to the actual i2c address macros (fix this in python) 

Get rid of all these flags 

switch to my wifi sending method use datamanger to access stored structs

More handling functions with following workflow 
pass the dataManager class/struct to all of them 
 velocity Handler 
    '->right_DOF handler 
	deal with flagging for velocity or torque 
	'->dof_cmd_handler 

  torque handler 
   '-> right_DOF handler 
	deal with flagging for velocityor torque 
	'-> dof_cmd_handler 

Read Faces funciton 
'> request_face_state x4  
 	'-> write face_state to struct
		(put vel and pos estimations in here) 

init_wheel_pos (whatever wheel ) 
   '-> set_face_state 


global changing variables / flags can be in device manager 

Setting the face names to be the same number as i2c address 

current_position_right why can't we retrieve from the object? in the callbacks

Need to fix classes So that updateState explain the debug shit but i guess its ok ? 

check header symbol defs
