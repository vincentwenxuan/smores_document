************************************************************************
Orginal Layout Notes:

--Add large supply cap to motor driver sheet.
--Eliminate capacitors to balun balanced inputs and add 100 p capacitor to balun unbalanced output, as per reference design from Atmel.

************************************************************************
After Testing:

Fix:

OK -- flip crystal footprint (upside-down)
OK -- feed motor controller / LDO enable direct from battery
OK -- protect gound pad on bottom of motor driver
-- add vias to SPI lines
-- add vias to I2C lines
-- add vias to clock lines

MAV Features:

OK -- shrink board size
-- reduce board thickness
NO -- consider 45 degree IC orientations
OK -- check on 0402 footprint sizes
OK -- add more LEDs (red, yellow, green, blue, white)
OK -- swap motor thru holes for pads
OK -- plan for battery connector
OK -- add analog / uart pins for sonar sensor
OK -- add pwm pads to control CX2

Dongle Features:

-- design as single-sided two-layer
-- add silkscreen labels for output pads on both sides
-- add vias near output pads on both sides
-- charge state indicator (or on MAV?)
-- power indicator


-- Power features
  -- MAV battery removable
  -- MAV battery easily disconnected (power switch)
