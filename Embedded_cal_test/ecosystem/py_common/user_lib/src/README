Python Packet Utils Package:
  This might be a good place for useful things ....


Notes: 
  - [some string] means substitute in your configuration specific information without the []
  - the token "$" means "execute this command in your bash shell"

Setup:
  $ cd to the ecosystem directory
  echo "export ECOSYSTEM_PATH=$PWD" >> ~/.bashrc

  Another acceptable way to do this:
    - $ echo "export ECOSYSTEM_PATH=[your path to ppr_code]" >> ~/.bashrc
  For instance, on my machine:
    - $ echo "export ECOSYSTEM_PATH=/home/ujb/Projects/ppr_code" >> ~/.bashrc
