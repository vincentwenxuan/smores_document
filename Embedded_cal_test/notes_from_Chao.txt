All smores code is named smores_

ecosystem:
- all smores-specific library files are in smores_common
- already modify Makefile to compile codes in smores_common
- DC_Motor, Polynomial, Trajectory, PID_Control, Wheel_Control
- smores_template and stm32f303_discovery_template
- smores_pid_control is the previous version of pid controller which is useless now.

atmega:
- written outside ecosystem (all code in atmega directory)
- atmega template includes all coding part you need to program ATmega and it can be used independently, but it's not necessary for smores project
- Projects in project directory
- To set up new project, copy smores_face_board_template and rename
- twi = I2C testing
- wiper_encoder_test is the face board testings setup code
- the Utility folder allows you do use windows
- Don't use ATMEL studio in windows. Just use a normal text editor
- common library includes basic functions (ADC, PWM, etc)
- example includes the examples of USART, PWM, ADC and TWI

In the Makefile, there are four commands:
 - make, make flash, make clean, make fuse
 - with the new atmega chip, you must program the fuse first (when you first start using the chip)
    - you can't program the chip correctly with make flash before doing this.
    - it configures the clock.
